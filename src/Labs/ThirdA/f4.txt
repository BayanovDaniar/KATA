Dear Daniar 12 2
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin' 53 10
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom 58 13
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em 60 12
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin' 62 11
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em 58 10
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter? 65 11
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father 56 10
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? 49 10
I'ma name her Bonnie 22 4
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry 47 9
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him 65 13
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan 67 13
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam 56 11
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man 58 12
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat 61 13
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back 48 10
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan 59 11
